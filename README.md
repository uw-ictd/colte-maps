# CoLTE Maps
CoLTE is the Community LTE Project. It is designed to be an all-in-one turnkey
solution that sets up a small-scale locally-run LTE network. CoLTE consists of
several main elements working together. You can check out the main colte project
at [https://github.com/uw-ictd/colte](https://github.com/uw-ictd/colte).

This repo contains a fork of the Open Street Maps editing server that was
modified to support offline operation. At this time this fork is not being
maintained, so use at your own risk. If there is significant community interest
in reviving it, contact colte@cs.washington.edu or open an issue here to discuss
your needs.
